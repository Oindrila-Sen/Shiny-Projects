# Predict Your Child's Height at 18!
This is my first attempt at Shiny to predict a child's height when grownup. 

I have used the "GaltonFamilies" Dataset from the package "HistData" and 
have created a Linear Regression Model for the Prediction.

The App is available <a href = "https://what-the-data-says.shinyapps.io/predict_height_of_your_child/" targer = "_blank" > here.

Thank You!
